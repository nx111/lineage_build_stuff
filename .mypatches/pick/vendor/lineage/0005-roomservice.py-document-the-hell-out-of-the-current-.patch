+# The purpose of this script is to import repositories (in addition to the ones
+# already specified in .repo/default.xml and .repo/manifests/snippets/cm.xml),
+# in order to satisfy the needs of a build for the lunch combo given as argument ($1).
+#
+# There are 2 scenarios, differentiated by the value of the depsonly parameter ($2).
+# The build/envsetup.sh will try to find a lineage.mk file, placed in a ${product} folder,
+# anywhere in the device/ subfolders.
+#
+# (a) If it finds such a ${product}/lineage.mk file ("depsonly" is supplied as true):
+#       - The device repository is already there. Just its dependencies need to be downloaded.
+#         The "depsonly" parameter is supplied as "true".
+#       - To the end of fetching repositories, it will collect them from the dependencies files
+#         (lineage.dependencies and cm.dependencies) of the projects in roomservice.xml.
+#         It will recursively search for more dependencies in the repositories it finds, and
+#         populates roomservice.xml with all new findings.
+#       - After this process is over, all new projects in roomservice.xml are force-synced.
+#
+# (b) If no such ${product}/lineage.mk file is to be found ("depsonly" is not supplied):
+#       - The device repository is not there. The roomservice script has the additional task of
+#         finding it. Therefore, the "if not depsonly" conditions present in the code below
+#         should be taken as synonymous with "if device makefile isn't there".
+#       - An attempt is made to use the Github Search API for repositories that have ${device} in
+#         their name, for the LineageOS user.
+#       - Of all repositories that are found via Github Search API, the first one taken to be
+#         the true device repository is the first one that will match the (simplified)
+#         regular expression "android_device_*_${device}".
+#       - After the above step is over, case (b) de-generates into case (a) - depsonly, as the
+#         device repository was found.
+#
+# In summary, case (a) can be considered a sub-case of (b).
