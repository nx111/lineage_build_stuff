Subject: [PATCH 13/19] roomservice.py: non-depsonly: bootstrap first device
 repo from Hudson

* This patch simplifies the way the script finds the initial device
  repository name and location, given its singular input of ${device},
  extracted from the lunch combo.
* Previously a Github API search was performed on the LineageOS repository,
  along with a regular expression to perform a match on a
  "android_device_*_${device}" form.
* This imposed certain restrictions on what can/cannot represent a valid
  device repository name for ${device}.
* This also had no way of controlling what happened if there were
  multiple matches on the regular expression above (the first match in
  alphabetical order was always chosen).
* Most importantly, this imposed the limitation that for a ${device},
  its corresponding android_device_${oem}_${device} repo had to exist.
  This negates the value of having multiple device targets defined in
  the same common repository, since roomservice would have no way to
  know it needs to fetch the common device repo and not the _${device} one.
* The updated script works by looking up "repository" and "target_path"
  for the ${device} it's supplied at input, in a JSON file stored in the
  LineageOS/Hudson Github repository (roomservice-main-device-repos.json).
* The syntax of this file is similar to lineage.dependencies, but the
  purposes of these 2 files do not overlap.
  The roomservice-main-device-repos.json should only used for roomservice
  to be able to bootstrap the first device repo. The latter should still
  contain a lineage.dependencies file for the other dependencies.
