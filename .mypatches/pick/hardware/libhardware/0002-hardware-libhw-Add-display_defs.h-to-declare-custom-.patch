Subject: [PATCH 2/3] hardware/libhw: Add display_defs.h to declare custom
 enums/flags

hardware/libhw: Add S3D format definitions

S3D video has various format like left/right and top/bottom,
and this definition will be shared by hardware composer and
its client.

CRs-fixed: 999055

hwcomposer: Add HWC_BLIT compositiontype value
- HWC_BLIT this layer will be handled in the HWC, using a
  blit engine
- setting this will inform Surfaceflinger to flip FB_TARGET
