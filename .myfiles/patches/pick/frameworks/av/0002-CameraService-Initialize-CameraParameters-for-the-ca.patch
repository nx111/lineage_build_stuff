Subject: [PATCH 02/11] CameraService: Initialize CameraParameters for the
 cameras and cache them onFirstRef

To avoid race with other clients and evicting conflicting client when first open camera.

Test: It prevents error "CameraService::connect evicting conflicting client for camera ID %s" when camera is opened for the first time after boot.
