+     Article 36 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the Right to Privacy. Article 202 of the
+     Criminal Code of Kosovo covers the infringing of privacy in corresepondence and computer
+     databases, which can be best explained as the act of violating and/or sharing a private
+     document with another person. Article 203 covers the unauthorized disclosure of confidential
+     information, when the person disclosing said information is under legal duty to maintain it as
+     confidential. Said person is not liable when the disclosure of the confidential information is
+     done so in the interest of the public. Paragraph 4 describes public interest as the welfare of
+     the general public outweighing the individual interest. It is also permissible to use this as a
+     defense when the disclosed information 'involves plans, preparation or the commission of crimes
+     against the constitutional order or territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo or other
+     criminal offenses that will cause great bodily injury or death to another person'. Article 204
+     covers the unauthorized interception of a conversation or statement. Article 205 covers the
+     unauthorized photographing or video recording of a person 'in his or her personal premises or
+     in any other place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy', with paragraph 4
+     offering an exception for liability when the act is done to 'conducted to discover a criminal
+     offence or the perpetrators of a criminal offence, or to present as evidence to the police,
+     prosecution or court, and if the photos or recordings are submitted to these authorities'.
+     It is beyond doubt that none of these articles deal with recording personal conversation
+     between two parties, hence the act of doing so is not explicitly punishable and is not a
+     criminal offense that would warrant a criminal case.

+     Recording a phone call when not one of the two parties participating in said call is illegal
+     and punishable by law. As a party to a phone call, one may record it without notifying the
+     other side, as is evident in the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia for case 35-KG16-18,
+     which was rendered on the 6th of December 2016. This concerns civil cases between two private
+     citizens. Whether this covers cases involving legal entities or people holding a public
+     position has not been researched. The key laws to consider are the Federal Law of 27th July
+     2006, N 149-FZ, (amended on 18th March 2019) "Information, Information Technologies and
+     Information Security" - article 9, subarticle 8, as well as the Civil Procedure Code of 2002,
+     N 138-FZ (amended on the 27th December 2018), article 55. Citations of other pertinent laws may
+     be found in the linked decision, starting at internal document page number 4.

+     the Portuguese Constitution. Infringing on said rights constitutes a crime, as defined in
+     Articles 192(1), 194(2) and 199(1) of the Portuguese Penal Code. The punishment is imprisonment
+     for a period of up to one year or a fine equaling 240 days of pay, either of which may be
+     increased by a third, based on Article 197. Lower courts and Higher courts have been ruling
+     both for and against recording one's own calls, no matter the reason, and there have been
+     numerous cases of exceptions being made, despite what the law says. A complaint has been lodged
+     with the European Court of Human Rights, which may lead to a reversal in the current laws and
+     prohibitions. It is noteworthy that in one case, the Supreme Court rendered a decision, which
+     can be translated as such: "The protection of speech that embodies criminal practices or the

+     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
+     According to Article 3(1) of the Protection of Communications Secrets Act, it is forbidden to
+     wiretap, record or listen to any conversation between other parties. Article 4 defines
+     recordings obtained by way of illegal recording or wiretapping as inadmissible, hence they can
+     not be used as evidence in a trial or disciplinary procedure. Article 14 goes on to specify
+     that no person shall record a conversation between other parties that is not public, or listen
+     to said parties' conversation through the use of electronic or mechanical devices. Definitions
+     of recording, wiretapping and other such terms may be found in Article 2. The Protection of
+     Communications Secrets Act clearly defines that recording is not legal when done by a third
+     party, but does not specifically discuss whether whether both parties to a conversation need to
+     agree to a recording. Since there is no penalty listed, recording one's own conversations
+     should be in, at worst, a gray area that should still not make the act punishable. Similarly,
+     whether recordings made without consent can be used as evidence is legally unclear.

+     A person must not use a listening device with the intention of recording a private conversation
+     to which the person is a party. This does not apply when said listening device is used by, or
+     on behalf of, a party to a private conversation if a principal party to the conversation

+     necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that principal party, or is not made
+     for the purpose of communicating or publishing the conversation, or a report of the

+     It is an offence to use a listening device to record a private conversation to which the person
+     is not a party and the device is used without the express or implied consent of each party to
+     the conversation. Under Section 43, a person may use a listening device to record a private
+     conversation if at the time of use there are reasonable grounds for believing the circumstances
+     are so serious and the matter is of such urgency that the use of the device is in the public

+     of substantial damage to property, or a serious narcotics offence, if the person using the

+     of that principal party. It is also not applicable in cases where a person who is a party to
+     a private conversation, or is acting on behalf of a party to a private conversation, uses a
+     listening device to record said private conversation, believing that the use of the listening
+     device is in the public interest.
+     Summary:
+     Most states and territories allow to make a recording of your personal conversations under
+     specific circumstances. The key exception is the State of South Australia, which does not allow
+     a party to single-handedly record their conversations. Since there is no way to distinguish
+     between the states and territories based on MCC, call recording will continue to be disabled
+     for Australia, until there are changes to the laws of the State of Victoria.

+     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
+     Call recording is not a criminal offense when it the recording is made by one of the two
+     parties of said call. Interception by a third party is illegal and punishable by law, unless
+     done according to the requirements set out in Law 9296. There may be some debate, as far as the
+     use of a call recording as legitimate evidence. Further information is available in the
+     attached legal discussions below.

+     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
+     The Chilean law is considered a type of civil law, hence judges base their decisions on their
+     own reading of the law. The Chilean Supreme Court ruled in favor of accepting one-party consent
+     call recording as a form of legal evidence, hence the act of recording your own calls is not
+     criminally punishable, as can be seen in the Chilean Penal Code.
